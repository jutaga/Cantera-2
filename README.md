# Worksop #4
# Topic: OOP and Object Modeling Exercises

# Exercise #1
Develop a Java class that performs the abstraction of a planetary system, taking into account for each body of the system aspects such as: mass, density, diameter, distance to the sun (assume circular orbits), a unique identifier number and a textual name. Include methods that calculate the gravitational attraction between any two bodies in the system.

# Exercise #2
Is it possible to run a java program containing several classes with main methods? If so, how do you determine the entry point to a program?

# Exercise #3
Write a java program that randomly generates (Help: See the Math class for how to generate random numbers in java) an array of real numbers, and sorts it using the bubble algorithm or quick sort (this should be user selectable).

# Exercise #4
We want to implement the control of a Ferry. To do so, create a Vehicle class and include aspects common to all vehicles such as number of passengers, presence or absence of crew, number of wheels, date of registration, means of transportation, etc. Include the methods that you consider appropriate.create a program capable of reading the data of 10 vehicles by keyboard and then list them on the screen.

# Exercise #5
rom the previous class, and by means of inheritance create new classes that allow to differentiate if the object is a car, a motorcycle, a truck, a bicycle, a boat, etc. Include in each class some specific attribute that differentiates it from the others. For example, for the car a Boolean that determines whether it has three or five doors, for the truck the height (indifferent in the other vehicles), etc. Make a program like the one in the previous exercise capable of working with the different types of vehicles.

# Exercise #6
An interesting predefined class in the java language is the Vector class, which implements the abstraction "dynamic array". Review the class and use it (in different files) to make a program that reads numbers from the keyboard until the same number is entered twice in a row. Then the program displays all entered numbers and terminates.
